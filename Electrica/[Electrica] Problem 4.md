# [Electrica] Problem 4

**Problem:**


Among the oldest ciphers used in practice are those of the ancient Romans. One particular Caesar cipher was used by Julius Caesar, and a similar one by Octavius. In this cipher letters are shifted along the alphabet by a constant number of positions.

Now the cryptogram below does not use the Caesar cipher, but uses an even older method of encipherment. Your task is to decrypt it and find the answer to this problem. 



**Cryptogram:**

Hello everyone, this is problem 4 from ***Electrica - the puzzle challenge:*** http://www.caesum.com/game/index.php.

This problem is about cryptography and our task is decrypt the ***cryptogram*** above.

**Define the Problem:**

- I will paste the cryptogram to https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier and let's see what happen!

:bulb:**Solutions:**

- As you can see the result which had decrypted after I paste the ***cryptogram*** is: **welldonethewordyouseekisatbash**.
- This is a readable string and finally, the answer here is "atbash".
